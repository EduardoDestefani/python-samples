# python-samples
Simple repository with Python3 software focused on data analysis and practical use in physics. The source codes were made using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), therefore, they are in .ipynb extension.

### Some stable software made

- [**python-ds**](https://github.com/EduardoDestefani/python-samples/blob/main/python-ds/source-code/python-ds_v0.1.ipynb):

Simple software for data analysis using numpy and pandas for interpretation and data structure, as well as matplotlib for graphical display of the analyzes.

- [**uncertz**](https://github.com/EduardoDestefani/python-samples/blob/main/uncertz/source-code/uncertz_v0.1.ipynb):

Simple uncertainty calculation software, automated for the end user, that is, it receives only formulas and error parameters given by the user in the input interface of the python interpreter.
